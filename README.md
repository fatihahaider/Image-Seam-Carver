# Image-Seam-Carver
Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), seam carving preserves the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image.
